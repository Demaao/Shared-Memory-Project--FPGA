# Shared-Memory-Project---FPGA-Design-pdf
This repository contains the final report and simulation results for my Verilog-based Shared Memory System project.
The project demonstrates a scalable and efficient hardware design that connects multiple cores to shared memory through a butterfly network architecture.
Only the documentation and results are publicly available here â€” the full Verilog source code and simulation files are private.
If you wish to review the full implementation, please feel free to contact me directly
